# Resonate_technical_test

Hi Resonate, thank you again for this exciting opportunity. It has been fun and quite challenging attepmting thiis technical test.
The application functionalities at the moment is only viewing contacts details and search for specific contact.
Some improvement I woudld make in the future:
1 - Adjust the grid layout so contact with same initial in name would be display on the same row (max 3 on each row).
2 - Add CRUD functionality.
3 - Clean up the code structure so it is more maintainable.

The app is deployed at: https://duydhk2000.github.io/Resonate_technical_test/

Or to run this application:
1/ Clone the repository / download the source code.
2/ Go into the contacts folder in terminal.
3/ npm install @mui/material.
4/ npm install react-media.
5/ npm start.
6/ The app should be on port localhost:3000.
